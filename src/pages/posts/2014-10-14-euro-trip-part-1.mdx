        "So I started the trip on 28th of October 2014. We took the flight in late morning from Amsterdam Schiphol to Berlin Schoenefeld and we were in Berlin at around 15:00 and took the train to Alexanderplatz. Honestly, at that time, I had no idea about Berlin, I had no expectations, but the moment I got off the train, I knew it was awesome. We had sandwich from Subway, I shot a small timelapse close to TV tower while eating. And then we headed to our apartment that I booked with Airbnb.",
        "We went in apartment, put our stuff and headed outside again. It was 9 or something, streets were awesome. I felt like I am in my home town. There were lights, small pubs, small shops, graffiti on wall and something was in air that made me feel home. Then we headed out for walk towards Alexanderplatz, there was some sort of festival going on there, we walked, enjoyed the cool wind and took pics. After that, we went back to Apartment and slept our asses off.",

        "We woke up, I went downstairs to get something from super market and I was again mistaken to be Spanish by the Chinese lady there. After the breakfast, we headed outside to roam around city and see a few places. We walked and took pictures. Then we went to see Berlin Cathedral. Architecture of the building is tremendous and the interior is brilliant. I visited every part of the Cathedral and took pictures.",
        "We spent quite sometime inside and then we decided to go to this place in Berlin called Classic Remise Berlin. The Classic Remise Berlin, a center for vintage cars, was opened in 2003 in a historic tram depot, originally built in imperial times, construction starting in 1899. Some architectural changes to the building were made in the 1920s. There were limited damages in the war, the places where firebombs damaged the building can still be seen on the ceiling. After the tram system was given up in then West-Berlin in the 1960s the depot did not serve any purpose and was in decay until the present owners bought it in 2002 and started to reconstruct it into a classic car center.",
        "After watching the cars that I'd love to drive but can't afford at the moment, we headed to Pariser Platz. Pariser Platz is a square in the centre of Berlin, Germany, situated by the Brandenburg Gate. It was dark already by the time we got there and it was magical. There were a lot of people yet it was still very cool place. The wind at that time was also very soothing and refreshing. I decided to take a few timelapse and hyperlapse around there. After walking here and there again, we decided to call it a day and went back to apartment. I guess watching so many things just in one day, not bad eh?",

        "Next morning, I went to see the Memorial of Berlin Wall. It was different than what I was expecting. You can barely find the traces of walls but there is enough information boards there that read the history of wall. I didn't spend as much time as I should have there moved to Museum Island to visit Altes Museum. I spent a few hours there in different sections of Museum, taking pictures and increasing my limited knowledge. After that, I was outside and I spent sometime in Museum Island and checked the other Museum from outside.",
        "Then I headed to see the Charlottenburg Palace and the gardens. I reached there in afternoon and it turned out that I can't visit the full Gardens because they're very big and I didn't had enough time before they're closed. I didn't want to waste the day and I said, I'll see what I can see and got the tickets anyway. The palace was very beautiful from inside. By the time, I was done visiting the palace, Sun was almost setting down.",
        "I came back to Brandenburg Gate at night and there I met a girl who was originally from Romania, but she lived in Austria and she was there for some business trip. We had discussion around culture, religion and how they contribute to the current situation of the World. After an hour long conversation, I decided to go back to apartment and sleep :).",

In the evening, I went to Berliner Fernsehturm also known as TV Tower of Berlin. Standing at the height of 368 meters, it is the tallest structure in Germany and gives you awesome view of Berlin. Only problem, windows are not as clean as they should be.",
        "After spending an hour or so, taking a 360 degree view of Berlin from tower, it was again time to go back. We spent some time in Alexanderplatz and then went back to home. I called my host (we got the apartment from airbnb), and he was up for a few drinks, we drank and then he ordered some spicy food and then had some good conversation around woman and law and order conditions in Pakistan.",

The architecture, small streets, that old Europe feeling.",

Those small streets, old buildings, people using Spanish. First thing first, I had to visit Sagrada Familia.",

We spent hours there, took a lot of pictures, watched sunset. The castle itself is also worth visiting. It was built in 1640 and offers panoramic views of the city and harbor. After watching the sunset, we headed back down and explored more of the city streets at night.",

        "Despite the face that we were so tired, we still decided to walk and visit National Monument in Vitkov which is National war memorial & history museum offering panoramic city views & a chic rooftop cafe. We got lost on the way to the monument and ended up roaming in streets of Prague.",
        "Later we managed to find our way to monument, which went through some nice nature and woods. Again, due to fall, the whole place was full of colors and everything looked so beautiful that it made us feel fresh again.",
        "That was our last destination of the whole trip. We went back to hostel after that and packed our bags and went to airport. It was my first trip in Europe and I knew that I'll be traveling soon again.",
