2 People, 1 mini camper van, 10 days, 2300 kilometers of drive, 200 kilometers of walk/hike. We drove around Iceland and saw some of the most incredible landscapes and powerful waterfalls.

Our day of exploring would start at 8 AM in morning and would finish around 1AM next morning. We stayed in a mini camper van and witnessed some of the awesomest sunsets that lasts for as long as 3 hours.

I carried a backpack with camera gear and tripod that weighted more than 12 kilos almost all the time. Here is a glimpse of beauty of Iceland through my lens.
