1 dude, 15 days, 7 countries, 11 cities, 2 flights, several buses. I started the journey by myself but made several friends on the way. I climbed 3 mountains, scaled city walls, saw beautiful lakes, saw Milky way for the first time in my life. Tried local food and drinks and had heaps of fun. These 2 weeks have been one of the best part of my life and it was mainly because of people I met!

Here is a 6 minutes time-lapse compilation that I recorded for hours in those countries. Take a look at that and you’ll know what I’ve seen.
