        "Very ambitious and busy day, had breakfast at Birch Cafe and then drove Lealt Falls viewpoint and then to Kilt Rock viewpoint. We went to Quiraing first but storm was raging so we decided to skip it and drive to The Fairy Glen. We hiked in the Fairy Glen and then drove back to Quiraing. On th way to Quiraing, we made a stop for lunch at Uig Hotel. We did the hike but at one point it got scary as winds were not letting us walk forward and it was becoming impossible to even maintain balance. After finishing hike, we drove to Staffin Beach and had dinner at The Hungry Gull. They had a pub night that evening so we got to sit with strangers and socialize.",
