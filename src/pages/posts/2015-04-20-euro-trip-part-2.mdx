import Timeline from "../../components/Timeline.astro";

So that was the first time, I traveled solo. In the beginning, I was wondering what I am gonna do without friend, or how I will navigate. 13 days, 5 countries, 7 cities, 2 flights, 5 buses, 1 long train, 500+ Kms of cycling. If you haven't done solo traveling, you're missing an experience of life, I highly encourage you to do so.

        "I could feel it, this is gonna be legendary. So I took took bus from Amsterdam Central to Eindhoven airport. It was sunny and shining out there. I could see happy people all around walking around and enjoying sunshine. I took the flight from Eindhoven and sat with two high school kids, they came to visit their friend in Utrecht, we talked briefly about life in Amsterdam and where and why I was headed.",
        "After getting off from the plane I took bus 200 that drops you at first metro station. I had to take two metros to reach my apartment. Metros are different here compare to Central Europe. My metro journey ended at Hósök Tere. Hősök tere (English: Heroes' Square) is one of the major squares in Budapest, noted for its iconic statue complex featuring the Seven Chieftains of the Magyars and other important national leaders, as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.",
        "I walked around the square and took some pictures and then started to walk towards apartment. On the way I grabbed pizza which by the way was crappy. Weather was quite decent. For some reason the weather reminded me of winters of Karachi. I closed my eyes and the cool wind and sound of tires on road made me feel like as if I am in Karachi.",
        "I decided to call it a day and do some planning for next 2-3 days.",

      description: [
        "I struggled to find a bike rental location until a helpful local guided me to a shop. I rented a bike and decided to leave my camera behind at the apartment. Obtaining mobile internet proved challenging due to language barriers. After visiting multiple stores, I finally got a working SIM card from Vodafone at WestEnd City Center mall.",
        "I cycled aggressively through Budapest's traffic, experiencing honking from buses and feeling energized by the dangerous riding conditions. I rode toward Buda Castle and photographed impressive architecture including the castle itself, a tunnel beneath it, and a Reformed church. I cycled up Gellért Hill despite physical exhaustion, describing the panoramic views of Budapest as appearing 'computer generated.' Descending the hill at high speed proved thrilling, with me traveling faster than cars on some slopes.",
        "I crossed the Chain Bridge and viewed the Hungarian Parliament Building and Museum of Ethnography from outside. After becoming hungry, I ate at McDonald's before heading to Margaret Island to cycle around its paths. I rested by the river listening to ambient music before continuing exploration toward City Park and Heroes Square.",
        "At my apartment, I met hosts and another guest from Frankfurt, discussing yoga, mathematics, and budget travel tips over tea. I dined at Paprika restaurant after a scheduling confusion, joining two Chinese students studying in Rome at a waiting table. The meal cost 30 euros total and featured traditional Hungarian dishes like fish soup and a layered dessert.",

        "I woke with a headache from overeating the previous night but pushed through with coffee and conversation before exploring the city. I cycled to Vajdahunyad Castle, which was conveniently located near my apartment, and photographed the surrounding area.",
        "While biking toward Saint Stephan's Basilica Church, I abandoned my GPS route to explore streets organically, discovering interesting architecture along the way. At the church and nearby Erzsébet Square, I appreciated the magnificent views and architectural details of Budapest's cityscape. I lunched at a Turkish restaurant where a staff member mistakenly identified me as Turkish, leading to a conversation in multiple languages including Urdu and Turkish.",
        "I visited Kerepesi Cemetery, an off-the-beaten-path location suggested by my host, and reflected on mortality as a natural process. The Botanical Gardens provided a peaceful retreat where I sat quietly, listened to bird sounds, and observed diverse plant species. I recognized local shopkeepers upon returning home, indicating I was becoming a familiar face in the neighborhood.",
        "At sunset, I cycled to Citadella and conversed with a Slovak couple about travel experiences while watching the city lights emerge. I met an Instagram friend for drinks at an Irish pub featuring live music, discussing topics ranging from fitness to religion over Guinness.",

        "I was supposed to wake up early in the morning but I don't have any alarm set up for weekends, and these days I am not tracking time and days. I took shower packed my stuff, made strong coffee, got ready. Had interesting discussion with another guest of my host who was French old lady, she spoke French and I spoke English but it all made sense, we laughed on something both of us had no idea about. I cycled around the neighborhood before returning a rental bike at 10 AM and received a sticker for my backpack.",
        "I traveled by bus toward Bratislava, enjoying the highway views of Hungary and a walnut cake purchased earlier. Upon arrival in Bratislava, I found the city center empty and settled into a geek-themed apartment decorated with Doctor Who posters and action figures.",
        "After locating a bike rental, I cycled to Bratislava Castle despite physical difficulty, but experienced loneliness at the top surrounded by couples. I overheard Canadian backpackers and joined them for a pub crawl, meeting people from multiple countries throughout the night. The pub crawl involved visiting several bars where I met people from Brazil, the UK, Australia, Ireland, Germany, and South Carolina before returning to the apartment around 2-3 AM.",

        "I woke up early without a hangover and enjoyed breakfast at a small café in the city center with bread, coffee, and honey cake. I explored Michael's Gate and the Church of St. Elisabeth (called the Blue Church), followed by visiting the Bratislava City Museum. I cycled to Slavín, a Soviet memorial and military cemetery situated on a hill, experiencing both the physical challenge and the beautiful views of the city.",
        "While exploring, I encountered an Indian couple and had a brief conversation about European winters before continuing my exploration. I attempted Slovakian potato dumplings at a local café but didn't particularly enjoy the traditional dish. After lunch, I cycled around the old town taking additional photographs.",
        "I returned to my flat for rest before an evening excursion that required cycling to Devín Castle, located approximately 15 km away. At Devín Castle, I found breathtaking panoramic views of the confluence where the Danube and Morava rivers meet. Unable to resist, I jumped over a fence into a private parking area to capture better photographs from an elevated viewpoint. I watched the sunset by the river while listening to ambient music, experiencing a moment of personal happiness and joy.",
        "After cycling back to the city in darkness, I visited McDonald's before returning to my accommodation. From my window, I observed the clear night sky filled with stars for about fifteen minutes. I met a Colombian family staying at the flat and had conversations about travel and our respective countries before ending my day.",

After packing and leaving a message for the host, I visited the post office to mail postcards, returned a rental bike, grabbed coffee and a croissant at a café, then boarded a bus to Vienna.",
        "Upon arriving in Vienna, I purchased a cheeseburger from BurgerMe and chatted with staff from India and Afghanistan before using Uber to reach my apartment. My initial impression: 'it was dull' due to cloudy, depressing weather, then I rented a bike and decided to cycle to Schönbrunn Palace based on online research.",
        "While cycling, I observed Vienna State Opera, but rain began as I reached Schönbrunn Palace, which was under maintenance and looked uninviting in grey conditions. Disappointed, I cycled back to the city center and explored Museumsquartier, photographing buildings with interesting lighting before returning to my apartment.",
        "I reflected that emotional connections to Bratislava's natural features—sunshine, sunset, hills, and the Danube—made Vienna seem less appealing, concluding: 'I cling to nature...cities don't appeal me!'",

        "I took a train from Vienna to Krems station which is like an hour and from there cycled to Melk. The cycling track is around 40 km one way... While traveling to the station, I encountered a Dutch couple from Utrecht attending a marathon and had brief conversation with them. I purchased train tickets and boarded, nearly missing the initial departure but catching a later connection to Krems.",
        "Upon beginning the cycling journey, I encountered stunning natural scenery: 'Sun on my face, refreshing air on my back, mountains on my right, river on my left.' I continued cycling while appreciating vineyards, flowers, and landscapes, stopping frequently to photograph the beautiful surroundings. After cycling approximately 28 kilometers, I rested and consumed Turkish cookies purchased the previous evening.",
        "On the return journey, I chatted with a Canadian family before cycling back to Krems station and returning to Vienna. Racing against closing time, I cycled urgently to return the rental bike, arriving just before closure and receiving free merchandise as reward.",
        "I ate Chinese food at a station shop, then returned to the apartment to pack, noting mild sunburn from the day's activities. I obtained train tickets to Warsaw online due to system problems and consumed roasted chicken with fries before boarding an eight-hour journey. I described uncomfortable sleeping accommodations shared with two Polish women and noted feeling happy despite minor discomforts from the experience.",

        "I woke at 6 AM after poor sleep in a train cabin, unable to sleep on one side due to risk of falling. After about ninety minutes, the train arrived and I met two backpacking women in the adjacent cabin with whom I initially traveled together. The three of us exited the central station together seeking a hostel, but separated when one woman grew frustrated with hunger and my phone battery ran low.",
        "I explained my decision to book accommodations spontaneously rather than in advance, comparing it to extending running distances—pushing personal boundaries and gaining additional experiences. At a Costa Coffee shop, I consumed nearly a full cup of coffee and an extremely sweet cake that proved too sugary to finish. I found and booked a hostel that appeared 'shady' and resembled the setting of a horror film.",
        "After checking in and charging my phone, I visited a nearby café called CUD MIÓD and ordered Polish meat dumplings on the waitress's recommendation, finding them delicious. I rented a bicycle from a shop, chatting with a female employee who cut off a jammed lock using large bolt cutters.",
        "I cycled to Łazienki Palace and Park but found the grey, dull weather prevented enjoying the scenery. Cycling through the evening, I spotted a colorful building but found Warsaw's cycling infrastructure difficult to navigate. I admitted feeling bored with the city's urban environment of high-rise buildings and busy people.",
        "At a Starbucks, I spent two hours writing before visiting the Presidential Palace. I ate McDonald's on the return journey and photographed the illuminated Palace of Culture and Science at night. I concluded Warsaw failed to impress, hoping something tomorrow might change my perspective about the city.",

        "I woke up early at the hostel feeling uncomfortable, had breakfast at Starbucks, and noted it was a sunny day in Warsaw. I participated in a free walking tour starting at 10:30, recommended by a Canadian friend named Joe. 'The idea behind free walking tour is, we go around in a certain historical area and the guide give us information of buildings/places and history behind them.'",
        "During the tour, I met travelers from Brazil, Slovenia, and the United States. The group took a break to have beer together. I had lunch with a U.S. Army worker and discussed 'war, religion and likewise topics' after the tour concluded.",
        "I joined a second tour focused on Warsaw's food and beverages, sampling donuts, vodka shots, cheese with baguette, dumplings, and five types of beer. After leaving the bar to spend time alone, I retrieved my bicycle and cycled around the city, stopping at Starbucks and McDonald's. I felt somewhat lonely despite the day's activities and activities, returning to my hostel bunk bed to rest.",

        "I had a poor night's sleep at the hostel due to various disturbances and left early to get coffee and settle my bill before returning a rental bike. Uncertain about my plans, I spent 45 minutes searching for a pizzeria I had visited during a food tour the previous day.",
        "At the restaurant, I encountered two girls from the previous day's tour and suggested attending another walking tour together. Upon checking the tour schedule, we realized it had started three hours earlier, so the group invented 'a new thing/dance called Kangaroo/Penguin jump' instead.",
        "We visited the Mermaid of Warsaw, a symbol of the city, and took selfies at the location. We proceeded to the Bell of Warsaw, where legend suggests jumping around it fulfills wishes; we completed four jumps for a significant wish. We engaged in various spontaneous activities including rolling down a slope, jumping in a forbidden fountain, and playing at a children's park.",
        "After playing frisbee and becoming tired, we purchased refreshments and decided to have dinner together at a restaurant called Radio Cafe. Following dinner and games, my new friends needed to catch a train while I needed to board a bus from the station. The bus departure was delayed, forcing me to catch transportation from another station, resulting in an uncomfortable journey with cramped seating.",

I arrived in Vilnius early morning, struggled with GPS confusion, took a cab to the hostel, and discovered the reception wouldn't open until 10 AM. Seeking warmth in cold weather, I found shelter at McDonald's, then visited a post office to send postcards before returning to check in.",
        "This hostel was way better than the last one, In fact it's one of the best hostel I've ever stayed in and I'd totally recommend it. I joined a walking tour despite poor weather conditions, noting the tour guide's beautiful accent despite not thoroughly enjoying the experience. After the tour, I visited Gediminas' Tower with two Australian travelers met during the walking tour to see the city views.",
        "I discovered a recommended restaurant, tried Lithuanian cuisine including beer and Didzkukuliai (Cepelinai), and made an evening reservation. It was delicious and huge in quantity and couldn't finish all of it. I realized that life and food is supposed to be share with someone. Planning to attend a pub crawl, I reconsidered and stayed in the hostel instead, prioritizing sleep and avoiding potentially regrettable decisions.",

After freshening up, I went to the hostel reception to rent a bike, where a friendly staff member named Justina offered coffee and helped arrange the bike rental. I cycled through familiar areas from the previous day and explored new locations around Vilnius.",
        "Having skipped breakfast, I stopped at Berneliu Uzeiga restaurant for brunch, ordering Lithuanian stew with potatoes and lemon cheesecake for about 8 euros. After paying for the bike rental, I met a teenage hostel guest interested in rap music and learned this person had been making noise the previous evening.",
        "I decided to cycle to six lakes located 17-18 km northeast of the hostel, despite having only a basic city bike without gears. During the 30-minute ride, I exited the city and encountered a cyclist who warned about the risky terrain and my lack of safety equipment. A rural house with burning coal and wood triggered nostalgic emotions about northern Pakistan, causing me to cry while cycling as I reflected on how much has changed since my teenage years.",
        "I entered a forest and continued cycling despite uncertainty, eventually finding a glimpse of a lake and deciding to explore it despite risks. I crossed a natural gutter using a fallen tree as a bridge, lost balance but remained unharmed, then walked down to reach the lakeside. I spent precisely 4:26 minutes at the lake, matching the length of Brian Eno's ambient composition, before beginning the exhausting return journey.",
        "The return cycling proved physically demanding; I had to walk the bike during steep sections but eventually reached the city center, buying and consuming two juices rapidly. After refreshing at the hostel, I returned to the same restaurant for dinner, ordering a traditional Lithuanian fried potato dish with meat and peas, plus a lemonade and 7UP mix.",
        "I walked through Vilnius at night toward City Hall and Gediminas Tower, taking photographs of the illuminated city before returning to the hostel. I concluded that Vilnius is 'a small city of people with beautiful faces and hearts and awesome food.'",
